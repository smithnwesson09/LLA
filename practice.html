var revenue1 =
    "Revenue in 2017 increased $13.02 BILLION, or 47%, compared to 2016. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by the continuing decline in Payments revenue." +
    "The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices." +
    "For 2017, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 88% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 83% in 2016. " +
    "Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2017 included:" +
    "(i) an increase in average price per ad," +
    "(ii) an increase in users and their engagement, and " +
    "(iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on mobile devices. " +
    "We anticipate that advertising revenue growth will continue to be driven primarily by price rather than increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed." +
    "In 2017 compared to 2016, the average price per ad increased by 29%, as compared with approximately 5% in 2016, and the number of ads delivered increased by 15%, as compared with approximately 50% in 2016. " +
    "The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on News Feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes.\n" +
    "Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. " +
    "We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, " +
    "which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. " +
    "For instance, our advertising revenue increased 26%, 27%, and 31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 declined 9% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n" +
    "Payments and other fees revenue in 2017 decreased $42 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. The decline in Payments and other fees revenue was primarily due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by the revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. We anticipate Payments revenue will continue to decline, and such decline will be offset by increases in revenue from various other sources.\n" +
    "2016 Compared to 2015. Revenue in 2016 increased $9.71 billion, or 54%, compared to 2015. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue.\n" +
    "The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed. For 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 77% in 2015. Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, (ii) an increase in user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in News Feed, as well as the quality,\n" +
    "In 2016 compared to 2015, the average price per ad increased by 5% and the number of ads delivered increased by 50%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth.\n" +
    "Payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased $96 million, or 11%, compared to 2015. The majority of the decrease in Payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers.\n" +
    "No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n" +
    "Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue\n" +
    "The general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 had a favorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $40.36 billion and $39.65 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $293 million and $292 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2017.\n" +
    "The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $27.91 billion and $27.15 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $270 million and $269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2016.\n" +
